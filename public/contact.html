    <h1>I'll tell you more about myself...</h1>
    <p> Hi, my name is Ardee, an aspiring Full Stack Web Developer passionate about building responsive, user-friendly, 
        and efficient web applications. I’m currently learning the full stack development process, focusing on technologies
        like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and databases. <br/><br/>I enjoy solving problems, creating intuitive user experiences, 
        and continuously improving my skills to deliver scalable and modern web solutions. My goal is to grow into a versatile developer 
        who can handle both front-end and back-end challenges while keeping up with emerging technologies and best practices. <br/> <br/>When I’m not coding, 
        I love exploring new ideas, learning new skills, and finding ways to turn concepts into real, working projects.
    </p>

    <h4>My Hobbies</h4>
    <p>When I am not working and coding, I do outdoor activities such as Fishing, Biking and just going around somewhere.
